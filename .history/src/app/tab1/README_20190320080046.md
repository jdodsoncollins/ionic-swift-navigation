### Demo for navigation between Ionic 4 view and native (Swift + storyboard) view

This simple project is an iOS app with two views. 
- The first view (the initial view) is a nearly-empty Swift `UIViewController`
= The second view is an Ionic + Angular project

The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate nativating back and forth between these two views. The more complex of the two is the navigation *from* the ionic view into the Swift-powered UIView since it involves calling native APIs to initiate a view controller.

#### Build Instructions
